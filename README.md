# Code Quiz

## What better way to test your knowledge than a quiz? This site offers a simple quiz with choices, prompts, and a high score table that stores all your best times! This site was made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using Web APIs to track scores and progress! Learning how to implement Js into a site to give it functionality allowed me to learn how to roadmap my projects. Now get to learning!
